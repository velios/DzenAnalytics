 *   • transfer — between two of the user's own accounts, neutral on net.
 *   • refund   — money back from a previous expense (returned purchase,
 *                cashback within an expense category, etc.). Renders as
 *                an inflow on the account, but aggregates as a *negative
 *                expense* on the original category — i.e. it shrinks the
 *                category's spend, never inflates income totals.
 *                Zenmoney encodes refunds as `income > 0` transactions
 *                tagged with an *expense* category (a tag whose
