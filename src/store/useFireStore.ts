/**
 * FIRE dashboard settings — which accounts count toward the "current capital"
 * that's subtracted from the FIRE target.
 *
 * We persist an *exclusion* list (by account title) rather than an inclusion
 * list, so the sensible default — "count everything I have" — needs no upfront
 * configuration and automatically picks up newly-added accounts. In particular
 * this means accounts that Zenmoney keeps *out* of its net-worth balance
 * (`inBalance:false`, e.g. savings/brokerage) still count toward FIRE capital
 * by default, which is exactly what the user expects: that money is real
 * accumulated capital even if they hide it from their day-to-day balance.
 *
 * Archived accounts are never counted (they're closed), independent of this list.
