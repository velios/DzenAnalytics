// Sync log — a persistent rolling list of recent sync/push/snapshot events.
//
// Why this exists:
//   • The header toast / inline flash only show the *last* result and
//     auto-dismiss after a few seconds. If the user wasn't looking,
//     they have no way to find out what happened.
//   • When two-way sync errors out, we need an "open the log" hand-off
//     so the user can see *why* a push failed (skipped reasons, server
//     error messages, etc.) without digging through devtools.
//   • A persistent history also makes "is sync working today?" easy
//     to answer at a glance.
//
// Lives in IDB (key "syncLog") with a hard cap of MAX_ENTRIES; older
// entries are dropped on append. Cheap to read on hydrate (single
// JSON blob), cheap to write (one debounced save per operation).
//
// Non-React paths can call `useSyncLogStore.getState().append(...)` —
// the store is intentionally non-hook-only so push/snapshot helpers
// in `lib/` can write to it without going through React.
